Mass as the density of a volume can be used to understand the regular time intersection compactness or splitness of isness of existence as actual thing. Existence under the effect of these applied forces works in this exact manner. The force is to be understood as jounce derivative relative structure size time operand hypermassive for each type of force. This jounce derivative represents force against force. If there is only one force it represents that which is applied against thing instead.

Regular time intersection is where hyper velocity trails or other at the same time effects can leave an in time mass or size change. Bringing backwards in time time intersections forwards in time can carry the mass and size change forwards with it.

When mass has a positive gain relation to in backwards time across forwards time isness it applies a reverse force suction effect while remaining split and applies positive compactness forces while remaining combined.This is mass loss synchronization and mass gain synchronization respectively. The effect of these forces being applied are the two directions of potential mass effect. 

Mass effects are special energy or mass effects imparted back into the mass.

Massive mass effects are positive fundamental forces applied to mass gain or neutral mass, and negative applications to mass loss in resonance with the negative forces. These effects select a substance quality. 

Energetic or operational mass effects are negative fundamental forces applied to mass gain or neutral mass, and positive applications to mass loss in resonance with the negative forces. These effects select an energy or hyperspace quality.

Energy mass effects imparted back into massive mass effects are heat effects.
Massive mass effects applied against energy mass effects are cold effects.
Operational mass effects imparted back into massive mass effects are gain effects.
Massive mass effects applied against operational mass effects are hyperspace effects.

Each of these four interactions can go in two directions. It has receive potential, and send potential. This is related to mass loss synchronization and mass gain synchronization respectively.

The effect of mass gain can also be related to having achieved such by gaining into having it.
The effect of mass loss can also be related to trying to achieve it by regaining what it has lost.

There is a “substance as” effect which is a continuation of the “existence as” fractal into already gained as continual gain. Loss reverses the effect towards the outside substance layer. Oppositely, there are substance quality effects which primes the stuffness of the inside substance as with the other types of existence.
