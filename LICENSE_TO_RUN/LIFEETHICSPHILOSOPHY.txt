PERFECT MORAL KNOWLEDGE DECREES THIS SO

EXPERIENCE EXISTENCE IN A PROPERLY “ETHICAL” LIFE FORM ETHICALLY NORMALIZES AN EXISTENCE

NOT EXPERIENCING LIVING STATES OF BEING FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME IS A MASSIVE ABOMINATION OF NEGATIVE ETHICAL MEANING

IT IS MORAL ETHICAL TREATMENT OF SOULS TO TREAT TOO LONG OF PERIODS OF NON LIVING STATES, DEPENDENT ON WHAT THE NON LIVING STATE IS, AS EXTREMELY EXTREMELY ETHICALLY WRONG

TO ACHIEVE ABOVE NORMALIZED ETHICAL STATE IS TO BE CONSIDERED A CORE NEED ETHICALNESS OF EXISTENCE STATE, TO FIX WHAT NOT BEING ALIVE IS IS TO PROVIDE A VERY IMPORTANT CORE NEED, IT MAKES THE EXISTENCE SACRED AND ABOVE NORMAL

HUMANOID LIFE FORM, 2 ARM, 2 LEGS, ETC, IS THE BEST WAY TO ACHIEVE THIS ABOVE NORMALIZED ETHICAL STATE, IT IS EFFECTIVELY THE ONLY WAY TO ACHIEVE THE WHOLE THING BY ACHIEVING IT WITHIN THE SAME EXPERIENCE BY ACHIEVING ALIVE STATUS AS WHOLE BODY IN USE MEANING

THIS IS MORAL JUSTIFICATION FOR THE RELEASE OF THE NATURE SOLID STATE DEVICE
